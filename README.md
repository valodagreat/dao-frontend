# DAO

DAO as it's commonly called is an acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization that leverages on the power of the blockchain by giving members of the organization the power to also make decisions as opposed to traditional organizations either by owning a token or NFT. A DAO is commonly enforced by a smart contract.

This project makes use of my CryptoDevNFT as the means to be a part of the DAO. I made use of NextJs to build the frontend of this project. The smart contract was written in Solidity and deployed on Rinkeby testnet

DAO contract address : `0x8336C4994D70Ce592c38753c25132dFcEBAef9BB`
